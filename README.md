# Training a Domain-Specific Language Model for Next-Word Prediction Using Biomedical Texts from PubMed Central

## Project Objective
To build and evaluate a **domain-specific language model** trained on biomedical literature.  
The goal is to enhance **next-word prediction** capabilities in medical contexts, enabling more **context-aware text generation** for healthcare and clinical NLP applications.

## Dataset
**Source:** [PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMC-OA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/)  
This dataset includes a large collection of full-text biomedical articles, freely available for research and model training purposes.
